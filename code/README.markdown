Show Off Your Code
==================
Got skills in web development (preferably LAMP stack) and/or .NET applications? Here's your chance to show off.

Show us what you can do by dropping in some code you're proud of.  Add a `description.txt` file that explains the code and what's good or bad about it.  Include autotests and other related documents as appropriate.

Also, please let us know if you're a regular contributor to open source projects or have any websites you've created that are live on the web for us to look at.  Add those links to the `description.txt` file.
